Through this project we used an API that accessed a database of nonsense facts. The user's information was sent to Firebase and then retrieved by the backend. The backend then took that user data, stored it, and used Twilio to send the SMS along with a randomized introduction to the user every hour. 
Note: The main program is "MASTER".
